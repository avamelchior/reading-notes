## Notes I Took

**Word Processors:**

- Apple Pages

- WordPerfect

- … and many more

**Code Editors:**

- GitHub’s Atom

- Microsoft’s VS Code, Visual Studio
  
- Notepad++

- Vim, Emacs, Nano

- … and many more

**The Terminal (Command Line Interface)**

**File Explorer Tasks:**

- Find files

- Change directories

- Move and copy files

You can do all of those things in the terminal, but in a different way.

**Terminal Commands:**

- cd: change directory

- pwd: password

- ls: list

- ls-a: shows all files

- clear: clears everything

- mkdir: make directory

- cd (file name): takes you to file

- cd …: takes you back to top

- touch (file name): creates file

- code .: open text editor

Period before file means it is a hidden file.

CTRL+H to show hidden files (PC)
