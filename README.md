## Introduction
**My name is Ava Melchior, I have very minimal experience in working with HTML, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I am in DeltaV code school, and am going to be improving my skills in HTML and learning CSS.**

## What is a growth mindset?

**I believe that a growth mindset is all about having trust in your abilities to learn and adapt to new information, and not limiting yourself to the things you already know.**
- I will trust in my abilities.
- I will work with others and help when I can.
- I will not be afraid to ask for help when needed (after 15 minutes, of course).
