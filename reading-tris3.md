## Reading 3

**What is Version Control?**

**What is cloning in Git?**

- git add 'fileName'

**What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?**

- git commit

**What is the command to send your changed files to Github?**

- git push origin main

## Notes that I took from the slides:

**Git: Sharing code and collaboration: dvcs (digital version control system) for the masses**

- It’s a version control system
  
- It lets multiple developers work on the same code
  
- A history of changes to your files
  
- The ability to view, apply, and remove those changed
  
- Keep all of your project files in one repository
  
- Makes collaboration possible

**Snapshots in time:**

- Commits represent each successive version of a file or files
  
- Commits are the Git equivalent of “Save as…”
  
- Keeps track of all versions throughout time

**Keeping track:**

- Each commit has a label that points to it
  
- HEAD = the label meaning “You are here”
  
- Messages in Git are important

**What is GitHub?**

- Not git

- A way to share code with others

- An online place to store your code

***git + GitHub = Awesome***

**gitflow:acp (add, commit, push):**

**Add:** git tracking our changes

**Commit:** saves a snapshot

**Push:** takes local changes, update the cloud/remote server to GitHub online 

Add: git add fileName

	git status
 
Commit: git commit -m ‘why’

	git status
 
Push: git push origin main
